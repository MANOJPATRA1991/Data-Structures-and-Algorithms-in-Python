# Recursion

**Recursion** is a method of solving problems that involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller subproblems until you get to a small enough problem that it can be solved trivially. 
Usually recursion involves a function calling itself. 
While it may not seem like much on the surface, recursion allows us to write elegant solutions to problems that may otherwise be very difficult to program.

## Laws of Recursion

All recursive algorithms must obey three important laws:
  1. A recursive algorithm must have a base case.
  2. A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.
  3. A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.

## Key points to summarize regarding Recursion:

1. All recursive algorithms must have a base case.
2. A recursive algorithm must change its state and make progress toward the base case.
3. A recursive algorithm must call itself (recursively).
4. Recursion can take the place of iteration in some cases.
5. Recursive algorithms often map very naturally to a formal expression of the problem you are trying to solve.
6. Recursion is not always the answer. Sometimes a recursive solution may be more computationally expensive than an alternative algorithm.
