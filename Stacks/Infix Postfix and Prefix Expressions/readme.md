# Infix Expressions
B * C 
*This type of notation is referred to as infix since the operator is in between the two operands that it is working on.*

### Points regarding **precedence** level
- Each operator has a precedence level. 
- Operators of higher precedence are used before operators of lower precedence. 
- The only thing that can change that order is the presence of parentheses. 
- If two operators of equal precedence appear, then a left-to-right ordering or associativity is used.

# Prefix Expressions
+AB
Prefix expression notation requires that all operators precede the two operands that they work on. 

# Postfix Expression
AB+
Postfix, on the other hand, requires that its operators come after the corresponding operands. 

> The order of the operands stay exactly the same relative to one another irrespective of how they are arranged.
