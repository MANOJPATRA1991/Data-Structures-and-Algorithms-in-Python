# Infix Expressions
B * C 
*This type of notation is referred to as infix since the operator is in between the two operands that it is working on.*

### Points regarding **precedence** level
- Each operator has a precedence level. 
- Operators of higher precedence are used before operators of lower precedence. 
- The only thing that can change that order is the presence of parentheses. 
- If two operators of equal precedence appear, then a left-to-right ordering or associativity is used.
